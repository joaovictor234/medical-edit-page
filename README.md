# Getting Started

this is a test application. 

It was divided into two parts, one for the front-end, responsible for rendering the page and the data that comes from the back-end, and the back-end responsible for receiving requests from the front and returning the requested data or actions.

The back-end uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) as the database, it will be necessary to install it before running the application. It will also be necessary to create a database for the application to use.

By default, the backend creates a default username and password.

After downloading the code, in the terminal of each project type npm install, to install the project's dependencies. it will also be necessary to create the database. By default it is called **medical_db**

```
C:User/medical-edit-page/front>  npm install
C:User/medical-edit-page/back>  npm install
```

To run the application it will be necessary to access the root of each folder and from the terminal type **npm start**
