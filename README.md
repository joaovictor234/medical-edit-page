# Getting Started

this is a test application. 

It was divided into two parts, one for the front-end, responsible for rendering the page and the data that comes from the back-end, and the back-end responsible for receiving requests from the front and returning the requested data or actions.

The back-end uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) as the database, it will be necessary to install it before running the application. It will also be necessary to create a database for the application to use.

By default, the backend creates a default username and password.

To run the application it will be necessary to access the root of each folder and from the terminal type npm start
